# PackSage adapter feature todo

Updated: 2026-10-21.

Feature-grouped summary of the [tool roadmap](2026-10-13-todo.md). A mod can appear under multiple features. Unchecked items include missing implementation and implemented features still awaiting the stated live acceptance. Detailed contracts, evidence and acceptance limits remain in the tool roadmap and its linked reports.

Generic JEI displays or GuideME documentation do not establish dedicated mechanics or storage adapter coverage. Reliquified Artifacts shares the existing Artifacts logical integration.

## 1. Has adapter, not fully implemented

### Inventory and equipment inspection

- [ ] Minecraft — remaining entity cargo/equipment fixtures, mount switching and inventory-result semantics. Mule, chest-boat, chest-minecart and ridden-entity change handling are implemented and await live fixture acceptance.

### Enchantment mechanics

- [ ] Minecraft — per-level costs, effect payloads, effect decoding and item eligibility.

### Status-effect inspection

- [ ] Minecraft — attribute modifiers and active player effects.

### Potion-item inspection

- [ ] Minecraft — decode actual potion contents and additional custom effects. Inventory reads already return the raw component.

### Ability definitions and attributes

- [ ] Artifacts — decode ability components and item-specific attribute modifiers. Inventory reads already return raw item components.
- [ ] Reliquified Artifacts — effective definitions and bridge-supplied ability overrides through the Artifacts integration.

### Ability cooldowns

- [ ] Relics.
- [ ] Artifacts.

### Item rank and upgrade points

- [ ] Relics — rank, relic points and per-ability upgrade levels are implemented; nonzero values await live acceptance.

### Item upgrade state

- [ ] Relics — upgrade costs and availability beyond rank, points and per-ability levels.

### Guide item relationships

- [ ] Modonomicon — entry-to-item links; acceptance remains open.
- [ ] GuideME — page-to-item mappings; acceptance remains open.

### Guide recipe references

- [ ] Modonomicon — embedded recipe references; acceptance remains open.
- [ ] GuideME — recipe tags; unsupported nodes remain partial.
- [ ] Immersive Engineering — manual recipe references; remaining selector coverage and acceptance.

### Guide prerequisites and progress

- [ ] Modonomicon — prerequisite acceptance and dedicated visibility/unlock progress reads.

### Guide navigation

Entry and page opening, including after a full restart, is accepted for Modonomicon, GuideME, Immersive Engineering and Actually Additions.

- [ ] GuideME — installed scrolling to a heading below the top of a page; the installed Powah pages have only a top title heading.

### Guide reading before first use

- [ ] Immersive Engineering — model reads find no manual entries until the manual has been opened in the session. Navigation clicks already load it.

### Brewing discovery, recipe reads and planning

- [ ] Minecraft — localized potion-name matching, empty-page progress and brewing batch presentation.
- [ ] Actually Additions — investigate the native laser recipe read that returned no inputs.
- [ ] PackSage planner — investigate the empty Powah partial plans, then add other verified transformation semantics to bounded route planning.

### Guide search reliability

- [ ] Modonomicon — investigate the title-only and budget failures in guide search.
- [ ] Artifacts — investigate an empty partial tooltip result returned without a cursor.

### Construction geometry

- [ ] Immersive Engineering — native template geometry.
- [ ] GuideME — embedded structure definitions.

### Construction material requirements

- [ ] Immersive Engineering — native template materials.

### Command discovery, help and execution

- [ ] Minecraft — define the contract and permission boundaries, then implement command support.

### Shared reliability and chat acceptance

This is PackSage core work, rather than a missing third-party mod adapter.

- [ ] PackSage — freshness/continuation audits, version dispatch, coverage diagnostics, latency, citations, source presentation, search behavior and remaining parallel-chat checks.
- [ ] PackSage — adapter query execution through each provider's own live search and paging, and target references that keep their registered type.
- [ ] PackSage — installed recheck of the merged adapter-popup width and scrollbar.
